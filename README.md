# A threefold violating a local-to-global principle for rationality
This repository contains Magma code verifying the numerical claims in paper "A threefold violating a local-to-global principle for rationality" by Sarah Frei and Lena Ji. It contains the following verifications:
- X is smooth
- X contains a Q-point
- The genus 2 curve C associated to X is z^2 = -t^6 - 3t^5 + 2t^4 + 3t^3 - 3t^2 - 3t - 2
- 2 and 149743897 are the only primes dividing the discriminant of C
- Finds the two real branch points of C
- Mod 2, the Fano scheme of lines contains a smooth F_2 point
- Mod 149743897, the Fano scheme of lines contains a smooth F_149743897 point
- The mod 149743897 reduction of X is not conical
- The mod 2 reduction of X is not a variety (it is reducible and non-reduced)
